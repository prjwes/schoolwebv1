READY FOR DEPLOYMENT - QUICK START GUIDE
========================================

STEP 1: UPDATE DATABASE SCHEMA
==============================
Go to your hosting control panel (cPanel, Plesk, or phpMyAdmin):

1. Open phpMyAdmin
2. Select your school database
3. Click SQL tab at top
4. Copy ALL content from: database/schema.sql
5. Paste into the SQL editor
6. Click "Go" or "Execute"
7. Wait for confirmation (should take < 1 minute)

STEP 2: UPLOAD UPDATED PHP FILES
=================================
Upload these 2 files via FTP to your server root:
- student_details.php (contains edit form, fee calc, exam display)
- dashboard.php (contains correct exam counting, fee stats)

STEP 3: TEST THE SYSTEM
=======================

Test 1: Dashboard Access
- Log in as Student
- Go to Dashboard
- Should load without errors
- Should show correct exam count (1 exam = 1, not 9 for 9 subjects)
- Should show fee percentage

Test 2: Student Details
- From Dashboard, click "View Details"
- Should see student photo
- Should see "Edit Information" button
- Click "Edit Information" → form should appear
- Fill in fields and click "Save Changes"
- Data should save and refresh

Test 3: Exam Results
- In Student Details, scroll to "Exam Results"
- Should see exams grouped with all subjects
- Format should be:
  Exam Name | Type | Date | Subject | Marks | Rubric
  (one row per subject, grouped by exam)

Test 4: Fees Display
- Should show fee percentage bar
- Should calculate based on student_fees table

TROUBLESHOOTING:
================

If Dashboard shows blank:
→ Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Del)
→ Check database connection in config/database.php

If Student Details edit form doesn't appear:
→ Check browser console for JavaScript errors (F12)
→ Verify database tables were created (phpMyAdmin)

If Exam Results show wrong format:
→ Verify exam_subjects table was created
→ Check that exam_results have rubric column

If Fees show 0%:
→ Verify student_fees table has data for student
→ Check that fees are assigned to student
